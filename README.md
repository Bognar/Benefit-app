# Benefit-app
AngularJS app for Calculating benefits two-way binding and math formula
In real, at my job i had a need for an app that will calculate benefits which i must set into billing application. 
This is SPA built in VS 2015 that asks for two values(first one for price that needs to be set and second on for price of 
package person has now) and than gives back discount which needs to be entered into a special billing app.
